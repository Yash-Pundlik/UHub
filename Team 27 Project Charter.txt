Problem Statement:
                Due to the rise in university web based resources, there has been a demand for accessibility and organization among the student population. UniHub addresses this issue by offering students a unique and efficient framework; the application minimizes latencies by allowing users to access university portals on one web application. 


Project Objectives:
* Develop a web application that will arrange university portals in one location. 
* Develop a backend that allows a single login that holds login information to other web resources(single “master login”).
* Implement modules that interact with the necessary APIs to retrieve grades, course information/announcements, deadlines, and emails.
* Create a customizable interface to allow students to choose which modules they would like to see on his/her dashboard.
* Develop a social module to encourage collaboration and study groups among students in a course.
* To-do list to help keep students organize and prioritize tasks.
* Filter Information for Courses
* Piazza information
* Calendar implementation, using a service that allows calendar sharing.
* Weather information for Campus.
